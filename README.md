# About Project: #
In this project, I have implemented a simple TCP chat. 
The project involves programming one server that hosts the chat and multiple clients that connects to that very server and communicates with each other. It is a project for understanding the working of TCP/IP Connections.

# Content: #
The project consists of two files:
1) server.py: One central server that hosts everything and provides the data for the clients.
2) client.py: Program to implement the client.
